# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project for Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
<h2>Files </h2>
This repo contains files required for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project as part of the Data Science Specialization on [Coursera](www.coursera.org).
This repo has 3 files: run_analysis.R, codebook.md and README.md

<h3>Details </h3>
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used for the analysis is available at the site from where the data was obtained, [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The actual project data can be downloaded from here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

<h3>Project Summary </h3>
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
